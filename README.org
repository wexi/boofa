* General

This Atmel AVR8 bootloader was derived from [[http://www.roland-riegel.de/boofa/][Roland Riegel's BOOFA code]] by [[https://github.com/wexi?tab%3Drepositories][Enoch]]. It is governed by a GPLv2 license.

* Set-up

BOOFA fits the smallest 1KB boot size. Set Fuse High Byte to BOOTSZ1=1, BOOTSZ0=1, BOOTRST=1. Tailor boof_config.asm and Makefile to suit your application.

** Local project notes

1. BOOFA is launched (GREEN LED ON) if a TP5-TP6 link is detected (RED LED OFF) or when the application code is missing (RED LED ON). Otherwise, the application is launched (RED LED ON).
2. When BOOFA executes the AVR109 /Programming Mode/ is indicated by RED LED and only under this mode ("P") the Flash/EEPROM write commands ("B") would be recognized. On "B" command error, such as
   trying to reprogram the boot, /Programming Mode/ would be aborted ("L").
